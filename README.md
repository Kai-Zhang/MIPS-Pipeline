Pipeline CPU
====

## A pipeline cpu based on MIPS instruction set
* This is a project created by quartus. The *.v files is the vital Verilog code, and *.vt files under modelsim folder is for simulation.
* The cpu supports 20 instructions which covers most of vital arithmetic instructions and branch instructions.
* 5-segment pipeline with forwarding unit, static branch prediction, cache, and exception handler entry.

## Teamwork
* The project is done by the team of 2.
* I'm in charge of 3 of 5 pipeline segments, ALU, register file, barrel shifter, controller, memory, and exception handler entry.
